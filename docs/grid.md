## Demand-to-Bus Mapping

Electricity demand shares are distributed across the transmission network using
**demand-region clustering** with nearest-bus assignment:

| Load Distribution Method | Buses with Load | Total Load Share | Methodology |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Demand-Region Clustering** | 16 | 1.0 | Population-weighted clusters mapped to nearest buses |

### Load Concentration

- **Highest Load Bus:** PL58-220 (0.167 share)
- **Load Distribution CV:** 66.2% (coefficient of variation across buses with non-zero demand)
- **Load Balancing:** Moderately concentrated demand across buses

Transmission constraints affect supply-demand balancing, grid bottlenecks impact renewable
integration, and regional electricity trade opportunities are identified through this spatial load
representation.
